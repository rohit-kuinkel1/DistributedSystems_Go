99th percentile:    2.10775ms
Requests per second: 10444.45
Total duration:     957.446125ms

Performance Impact Analysis:
============================
2PC latency overhead: 481.2% (0.246ms additional latency)
2PC throughput degradation: 82.8% (3366.99 vs 19568.90 req/sec)
Consistency cost multiplier: 5.81x slower
Concurrent load impact: 220.6% additional degradation
============
- 2PC provides data consistency at the cost of performance
- Redundant storage introduces latency and throughput overhead
- Concurrent load amplifies the performance impact of 2PC coordination
- The trade off; Consistency and fault tolerance vs. performance
